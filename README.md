# HighCardGame

This is a card game that starts with 12 decks of cards face down.
Two players take turns choosing the top card from each deck.
The cards have a value of 1 - 10 and the players score is updated based on the card drawn.
After 12 cards have been drawn, the player with the highest score wins.
